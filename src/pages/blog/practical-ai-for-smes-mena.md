# Why practical AI beats hype for SMEs in MENA

Most AI initiatives fail for one simple reason: they start with the model, not the outcome.

## Start with outcomes
Pick one primary outcome:

- Reduce cost
- Save time
- Increase revenue
- Reduce risk

If it’s not measurable, it’s not a project—yet.

## The 3 best “first AI wins”
1. **Support & ops automation** (triage, routing, summaries)
2. **Sales enablement** (proposal drafts, account research, follow-ups)
3. **Internal knowledge search** (find answers fast, fewer meetings)

## A quick decision filter
Before building anything, ask:

- Do we have the data?
- Can we run it safely (privacy/compliance)?
- Can we measure success in 2–4 weeks?
- Will the team actually use it?

## If you’re unsure, start with a prototype
A small prototype can validate value quickly—without the cost of a full build.
